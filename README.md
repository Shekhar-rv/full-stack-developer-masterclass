This repository contains a devcontainer that is has Python 3.12 with a few vscode extensions I felt was useful (List of extensions can be found in the .devcontainer/devcontainer.json under customizations -> vscode -> extensions). The only prerequisite you would require to run this repository on your system would be to install docker and docker compose. After installing these, you should be able to open the repo in vscode and a prompt will pop up asking if you want to open the repo in the devcontainer. Click "Yes".
